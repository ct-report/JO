Contact Tracing - Jordan

**AMAN** - It has been developed for Jordan's Ministry of Health by COVID-19 JOTECH COMMUNITY, a group of tech-savvy volunteers. It relies on GPS location/path tracking & path-overlap with data provided by the Ministry of Health.

Those users, who have been tested positive, can choose to export & share their location log with authorized officials of the Ministry of Health. Indeed, only the authorised staff is allowed to access the Ministryâ€™s server & input infected-paths.
